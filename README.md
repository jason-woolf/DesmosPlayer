# DesmosPlayer
Program the action in your Desmos graph to create animations for videos, presentations, etc.
## Introduction
When I started making short math videos using Desmos for the visuals, I would write down the sequence of actions I needed to perform on the expressions while doing a screen capture.  For exampke:  1) Show expression 1; 2) Start slider for expression 1; 3) Hide expression 1 and show expression 2; and so on.  As my videos got longer and more involved, this became quite tedious.  If only there were a way to program those actions so it would just happen automatically!  Well, that is what DesmosPlayer will do.  You create an array of these actions, including pauses to get the timing right, and then click a button to start it running.
